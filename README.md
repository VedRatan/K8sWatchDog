# K8sWatchdog

K8sWatchdog is a Kubernetes monitoring tool designed to help administrators and developers to remediate faulty pods inside their cluster. It provides real-time fault remediations.

- K8sWatchdog internally uses k8sgpt to know about the faulty pods, so please make sure you have k8sgpt installed in your cluster. Install it from [here](https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt-operator).

Please see the installation guidelines [here](https://github.com/VedRatan/K8sWatchdog?tab=readme-ov-file#k8swatchdog).
